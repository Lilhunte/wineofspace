    <p class="aboutus"> <strong>WINE OF SPACE</strong><br>
        Brands in the wine industry In seeking to define wine brands,
        Spawton (1998) adapts King’s (1973) original definition of a brand,
        embracing the definitions above: “A wine product is something that
       is made in a winery: a brand is something that is bought by the consumer. 
         A wine can be copied by a competitor: a brand is unique. A wine can be quickly
        outdated: a successful brand is timeless.”  Spawton’s  definition helps, subtly, 
        to distinguish the qualities of wine and wine marketing deserving of special 
        consideration. We propose three main areas of difference between wine brands and other
        consumer goods brands. The first lies in the nature of the product, the second has to 
        do with how the consumer perceives the product and the third relates to the complex hierarchy
        of brand components. Let’s examine each difference in detail.  The Nature of the Product
        The agricultural nature  and complex production requirements of wine make it a different 
        market proposition than many other manufactured consumer goods. The production cycle is annual
        and much longer than most other FMCGs and, like all agricultural products, nature determines 
        the final quantity. Once vintage is fixed, there is a 12 month wait until the next vintage.
        Increasing the supply to meet extra demand requires both foresight and long term planning.
        Quality vineyards take at least three to five years to start producing premium fruit and 
        then the product itself may require storage for anything up to five or six years (and even
        longer for fortified wines). Even if the appropriate supply of grapes is secured, wine
        manufacturers need to ensure they have significant winemaking and storage facilities available.
